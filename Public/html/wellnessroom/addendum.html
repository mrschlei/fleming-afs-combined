<h1>Fleming Wellness Room Guidelines Addendum</h1>


<p>The following addendum is effective 9/9/2013 and is in addition to the Fleming Wellness Room Guidelines dated 2013.</p>

<p>There are a total of 14 lockers.  12 lockers with combinations will be available for assignment.  2 lockers with removable keys will be available for temporary use during workouts; items must be removed at end of workout.  The U-M accepts no responsibility for securing items and does not provide reimbursement for lost or stolen property.  The Building Manager will retain master keys and combinations.</p>
<ul>
<li>To be eligible for a locker you must be a Fleming building employee.</li>
<li>Fleming student employees are ineligible for the locker lottery.</li>
<li>Locker assignments will be through an annual lottery with locker assignment from January through December.</li>
<li>The Fleming Wellness Committee will manage the locker lottery. All eligible building employees requesting a locker will be assigned a number using the random number generator, with the first 12 (1-12) receiving a locker. If a locker becomes available during the year, the locker will be assigned to the next person on the wait list (number 13, then 14, etc.).  After the lottery, eligible staff may be added to the bottom of the wait list.  To enter the lottery or to be added to the bottom of the waitlist contact <a href="mailto:flemingwellnesschampions@umich.edu">flemingwellnesschampions@umich.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Lockers are to be emptied by the last working day of the year; new locker assignments will be available for on the 2nd work day after the holiday in January.</li>
<li>Locker combination is NON-TRANSFERABLE.</li>
<li>Due to the potential for bugs and other pests, food may not be stored in the locker.</li>
</ul>
